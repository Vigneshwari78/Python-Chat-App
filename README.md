This is a simple Python-based LAN chat application that allows multiple users to communicate over a local networking using sockets.
It includes a server script to handle connections and broadcast message, and a client script for users to join the chat.
Once the server is running on one machine, other users on the same network can connect by running the client and entering the server's IP address.
This project is ideal for learning the basics of socket programming and networking in python.
